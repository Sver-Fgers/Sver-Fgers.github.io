# A Working Knowledge Space

This is not a blog or a course.  
It is a public notebook where I think through ideas, learn in public,
and slowly build understanding over time.

Notes here are incomplete by design.

## How to read this space

- Notes are **not polished articles**
- Some ideas contradict each other
- Definitions evolve
- Links matter more than pages

If you’re new, start with a concept note and follow the links.
