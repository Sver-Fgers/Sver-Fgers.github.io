## A few quick notes to save us both time
- I don’t accept unsolicited guest posts. If I ever publish a guest piece, it’s because I invited it.
- This garden is intentionally ad-free. I value a quiet, distraction-free reading experience, for both my readers and myself.
- I do not exchange links or participate in backlink requests.  Growth here is organic.
- If you wish to republish something you find here, reach out first.  Words carry weight, and I value where they travel.

If your message relates to collaboration, reposting, or commercial use, please review the [[site policies\|site policies]] beforehand.
