## Welcome
This is my public knowledge space.

Welcome to my website, a platform that reflects my philosophy about life and serves as a personal portfolio.

This site is a personal digital space, a space for me to think publicly, explore and document ideas as they grow. It functions both as a digital garden and a blogging platform.

# A Working Knowledge Space

This is not a blog or a course.  
It is a public notebook where I think through ideas, learn in public,
and slowly build understanding over time.

Notes here are incomplete by design.

## How to read this space

- Notes are **not polished articles**
- Some ideas contradict each other
- Definitions evolve
- Links matter more than pages

If you’re new, start with a concept note and follow the links.
